<h3>Physical units in astrophysics</h3>
<p>
  Physical units in astrophysics are used to measure and describe astronomical
  phenomena and objects.
  <br /><br />
  Some of the most common units include light years, solar masses, parsecs,
  Kelvin degrees, and the speed of light. Astronomy and astrophysics involve
  measurements of extremely large and small quantities, so it is necessary to
  use unit systems that are useful for both macroscopic and microscopic
  measurements.
  <br /><br />
  The proper physical units are crucial in astrophysics to understand the scale
  and features of the objects being studied, as these are often immense and
  difficult to imagine without an appropriate frame of reference.
