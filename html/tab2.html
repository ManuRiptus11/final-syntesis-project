<h3>carbon 14 method</h3>
<p>
  The carbon-14 method is a process used in physics and archaeology to determine
  the age of organic objects. It works by measuring the amount of carbon-14
  present in the object compared to the amount of stable carbon present.
  <br /><br />
  Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon that occurs naturally in the
  Earth's atmosphere. When living organisms absorb carbon dioxide, they ingest
  both stable and radioactive carbon, and over time, the amount of carbon-14
  decreases while the amount of stable carbon remains constant.
  <br /><br />
  Through the use of special equipment, scientists can measure the amount of
  carbon-14 present in an organic object and compare it to the known amount of
  carbon-14 present in the atmosphere at a certain point in time. From this
  measurement, they can calculate the approximate age of the object.
  <br /><br />
  This method has been crucial in determining the date of many historical events
  and has allowed archaeologists and other researchers to have a better
  understanding of the past and how it has evolved over time.
