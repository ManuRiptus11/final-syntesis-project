<h3>Eratosthenes method</h3>
<p>
  He is best known for being the first person to calculate the diameter and
  circumference of the Earth, he did so by comparing the altitudes of the noon
  Sun in two places separated by a north-south distance. His calculation was
  remarkably accurate; He was also the first to calculate the tilt of the
  Earth’s axis (again with remarkable precision). In addition, he may have
  estimated the distance from the Earth to the Sun and devised to insert an
  additional day in the calendars every four years, producing the leap year. He
  created the first world map, incorporating parallels and meridians based on
  the available geographic knowledge of his time.
  <br /><br />
  The main reason for his celebrity is undoubtedly the determination of the size
  of the Earth. For this purpose he invented and employed a trigonometric
  method, in addition to the notions of latitude and longitude, apparently
  already introduced by Dicearco, so it well deserves the title of father of
  geodesy.
  <br /><br />
  By references obtained from a papyrus from his library, he knew that in Siena
  (today Aswan, Egypt) on the day of the summer solstice the vertical objects
  did not project any shade and the light illuminated the bottom of the wells;
  This meant that the city was situated just above the line of the tropic of
  Cancer, and its latitude was equal to that of the ecliptic it already knew.
  Eratosthenes, assuming that Siena and Alexandria had the same length (actually
  three degrees apart) and that the Sun was so far from Earth that its rays
  could be assumed parallel, measured the shadow in Alexandria the same day of
  the summer solstice at noon, proving that the zenith of the city was one over
  fifty of the circumference, that is, seven degrees° twelve' from that of
  Alexandria.
  <br /><br />

  According to Cleomedes, Eratosthenes used the scaphium or gnomon (a solar
  protoquadrant) to calculate that amount. Later, he took the distance estimated
  by the caravans that traded between both cities, although he could well obtain
  the data in the Library of Alexandria itself, setting it at 5000 stadiums,
  from which he deduced that the circumference of the Earth was 250, The result
  was subsequently raised to 252,000 stadiums, so that each grade corresponded
  to 700 stadiums.
