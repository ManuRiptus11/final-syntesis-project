<h3>Parallax method</h3>
<p>
  To measure the distance of nearby planets and stars, he uses elementary
  trigonometry methods. The parallax method is based on the measurement of the
  apparent movement of an object with respect to the most distant stars.
  <br /><br />
  Who invented it?
  <br /><br />

  This method was invented in 1533 by the mathematician Gemma Frisus, who
  discovered in 1578 that comets were not atmospheric phenomena, but were
  objects far from Earth and was one of the first to apply parallax.
  <br /><br />
  Daytime parallax: due to the rotation and translation of the earth, the same
  object in the sky can be observed in two positions if it is observed at
  different times
  <br /><br />
  Annual parallax: change of location of an object in the sky due to the
  translation movement of the earth, that is, its movement in orbit around the
  sun
